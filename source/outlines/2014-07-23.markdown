### Mythical Creatures

This morning we're going to work on the Mythical Creatures exercises.

#### Setup

Here's how to get the files you need. In your Terminal:

* switch to the directory where you'll keep your projects
* clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:JumpstartLab/ruby-exercises.git`
* change to the mythical creatures directory: `cd ruby-exercises/mythical-creatures`
* open the folder in your editor: `atom .`

#### Doing the Work

The recommended order is:

* `unicorn_test.rb`
* `vampire_test.rb`
* `dragon_test.rb`
* `hobbit_test.rb`
* `pirate_test.rb`
* `wizard_test.rb`
* `medusa_test.rb`
* `werewolf_test.rb`
* `centaur_test.rb`

Your general process is:

1. Run the test file (like `ruby unicorn_test.rb`)
2. If the tests fail, read the output / error messages and fix them
3. If the tests pass, see if there are any more tests in that file which have a `skip`. Remove the next `skip` and goto step 1.
4. If you've completed all the tests for that file, then move on to the next.
