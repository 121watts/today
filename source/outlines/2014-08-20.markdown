### Warmup

Here's a puzzle for you:

Imagine you run a soccer league and you need to create a schedule. Each team
plays only one game per week on Saturday.

#### Easy

Your league has eight teams. Generate (to the screen or to a file), a schedule that has each team play each other team exactly once.

#### Medium

Your league has two divisions of eight teams. Each team should play the other
teams in their division twice and the teams in the other division just once.

#### Hard

Your league has four divisions of eight teams. Each team should play each team
in their division twice and any two teams from each other division.
