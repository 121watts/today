## Building the Space (9:00-2:00?)

As much as possible we want you to feel like owners of the space, not just
people who hang out here. To that end, we spend the bulk of the first day
building and arranging furniture.

The room is currently in a "good enough" state for one class, we need to get
it ready for running the two classes simultaneously. That means:

* Relocating long-term storage items over to the other room
* Building the new storage shelves (Ikea boxes) to finish the mid-room divider
* Build new desks and chairs
* Setup small work areas
* Reorganize the couches
* Build storage boxes and have people nametag them

## Laptop Setup (2:00-3:00)

### Laptop Distribution

If you're taking a laptop from us we'll record the serial number then it's all
yours!

### Environment Setup

Then you need to make sure you have Homebrew, RVM, and Ruby 2.1 setup.

Follow [this setup tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/environment/environment.html)
but you can *skip the part about PostgreSQL* for now.
