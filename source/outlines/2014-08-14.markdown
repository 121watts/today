## Everyone

### Warmup

Let's skip warmup today.

### Lightning Talks (1:00-1:30)

After lunch let's gather in the classroom space for lightning talks.

## 1406

Today's primarily a work day. When you're not doing check-ins, push forward
on your project.

Some things to consider:

* Where did you think you'd be at this point? Are you there?
* How's the team working together? You still have a long time together. Today
would be a good opportunity to have a meeting about how the team is functioning.
* What were your learning goals coming into the project? Are you realizing them?
* Did you draw wireframes? Make other plans? Are you still following them, or
did you make conscious decisions to move away from them?

### Dinner Dash Check-Ins & Pairing

We're able to do some long sessions today. The purposes of the session are:

* for the instructor to get a sense of where you are
* to help you over any specific technical hurdles
* to review the quality of your work/code
* to help you push forward (through pairing, etc)

Sessions should last about 85 minutes, but the whole group doesn't need to
be together the whole time.

#### With Josh

* 9:00 - Emily Davis, Tim Proctor, Gustavo Villagrana, Robert Gu
