the awesome features 1406 students built for their IdeaBox projects.

### IdeaBox Work Time (9:00-Noon)

You have a bit of time this morning to finish things off.

If you're going to start a new extension, *please* use a git feature branch
so you can roll back to a working version of things aren't going well.

### IdeaBox Recap & Refactor (1:00-3:30)

This afternoon you can choose one of the following sessions, with the
restriction that no group should grow above six students. First come, first
served.

* Josh will focus on retrofitting tests onto an existing app
* Jeff will focus on pulling business logic out of the actions and down to the
models
* Jorge will focus on improving the style/structure of view templates and how to
implement view helpers

### Warmup

This morning let's try an infamous (but stupid) interview problem:

* Go through the numbers 0 through 100 (including both 0 and 100)
* If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
* If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
* Otherwise print the number

### Git Fundamentals (9:00-Noon)

This morning our goal is to both understand both (a) why and (b) how to use Git.

### Background

First let's set the stage and discuss Git at a high level.

* What is source control?
* Why use it?
* What came before git?
* What's in use now?
* Why was it created?
* What's the difference between git and GitHub?
* Centralized vs distributed source control
* Repo, branch, commit

### Source Control Made Easy

The late, great Jim Weirich explains source control and git better than we can. Let's check out his screencast:

### Try Git / Git Immersion

Now let's put in a bit of practice.

If you're brand new to git, start with try.github: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

If you've used git before (or complete try.github), work through Git Immersion: http://gitimmersion.com/

And, if you just can't get enough Git, check out the Pro Git book: http://git-scm.com/book

### Mythical Creatures Review (1:00-3:30)

This afternoon we'd like you to pair up to both (a) complete and (b) improve/refactor your Mythical Creatures.

* Find your pair below
* Work together for the entire afternoon session
* Meet up with Rachel at the specified time

If you finish the exercises, then check out the Mythical Creatures README for additional challenges.
