You may have seen that Turing is organized as a non-profit, expecting approval
as a 501(c)(3) from the IRS within the next 10 months.

I frequently then get the question "how's that working out for you?" And the
answer is..."it's difficult." The paperwork, the accountability, not qualifying
for things like SBA loans, etc. Yes, I'm familiar with "B Corps". But it's not
the same.

A big part of the 501(c)(3) decision was about investment -- *I'm against it*. I
bootstrapped Jumpstart Lab in 2009, so doing the same with Turing just made
sense. But if you look around you'll find developer education programs taking
investment left and right, some in the tens of millions of dollars.

That's a big problem. Investors don't give money, they lend it and *they expect it back*.
And in the tech world, they're looking for 10x return on investment. If they put
in 16 million dollars they're shooting for a payout of 160 million.

Where does all that money come from? **Students**. For every dollar an investor puts
in they want nine student dollars back. That tuition paid into the system, instead
of paying for their instructors and facilities, pays investors. That money is
sucked out of the ecosystem.

*What's right for investors is orthogonal to what's best for students*. If we claim
to be focused on the best outcomes for our students, then taking investment is
fradulent. We'd be lying to one side or another.

Is it hard to bootstrap while watching competitors take on huge investments? Of
course. But this is too important. I've made compromises on my beliefs in the past,
and I paid a huge price. It won't happen again. This is our chance to do it right.

And no outsider, regardless of how deep their pockets, will call the shots.
