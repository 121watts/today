We believe that becoming a developer is about more than writing code - we need to build
community while we build software.

When I started Jumpstart Lab I committed to being *aggressively open*. Since the beginning [all
of the Jumpstart Lab tutorials have been open source](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com). Without
the thousands of contributors who've put hours into the open source tools and technologies we rely on,
there would never have been a Jumpstart Lab in the first place. With Turing we're excited to
continue that tradition.

We run an in-person training program because we believe it's the best way to become a developer.
Specifically, we've decided to seek *critical mass* in Denver. As our classes spin up
through the rest of 2014 we'll grow to a daily student body of close to 100 developers. As we
get going with the design program in 2015 that'll approach 200. That's more than a class, it's a community.

But we'll still be *aggressively open*. Starting next Tuesday, June 17th, we'll start
"Turing Community Nights". These free, evening sessions will be free and open to anyone. They'll
always focus on getting new people into the larger development community. We'll run recurring sessions
on setting up your machine for programming, Getting Started with Ruby, and other content to get new
devs going.

But we'll also layer on deeper content, diving into the materials and projects that we use for our
Turing classes. We'll have sessions run by students and by our great friends in the Denver area. We'll
even stream them as Google Hangouts on Air to reach out beyond Denver.

We'll start things out
with session each Tuesday evening except for the 2nd Tuesday of the month. Based on the attendee numbers
and feedback we'll scale/adjust things to maximize effectiveness. We hope you'll join the Turing
Community group on Meetup.com and come join us.
