*TL;DR:* Join our new [Turing Community](http://www.meetup.com/Turing-Community-Events/) series on Meetup

We believe that becoming a developer is about more than writing code -- we need to build
community while we build software.

When I started [Jumpstart Lab](http://jumpstartlab.com) I committed to being *aggressively open*.
Since the beginning [all Jumpstart Lab tutorials have been open source](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com).
Without the thousands of contributors who've put hours into the open source tools and
technologies we rely on, there would never have been a Jumpstart Lab in the first place.
With Turing we're excited to continue that tradition.

We run an in-person training program because we believe it's the best way to become a developer.
We've decided to build *critical mass* in Denver. As our classes spin up
through the rest of 2014 we'll grow to a daily student body of close to 100 developers. As we
add the design program in 2015 that'll approach 200. That's more than a class, it's a community.

But we'll still be *aggressively open*. Next Tuesday, June 17th, we'll start
["Turing Community Nights"](http://www.meetup.com/Turing-Community-Events/). These free, evening sessions will be free and open to anyone. They'll
always focus on getting new people into the larger development community. We'll run recurring sessions
on [setting up your machine for programming](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/environment/environment.html),
[Ruby in 100 Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html),
and other content to get new devs going.

But we'll also layer on deeper content, diving into the materials and projects that we use for our
Turing classes. We'll have sessions run by our instructional staff, students and by our great
friends in the Denver area. We'll even stream them as Google Hangouts on Air to reach out beyond Denver.

We'll start with sessions on the first, third, and fourth Tuesday evening of the month. Based on the attendee numbers
and feedback we'll scale/adjust things to maximize effectiveness.

We hope you'll join the [Turing Community group on Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Turing-Community-Events/) and
look forward to seeing you there.
