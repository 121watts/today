People have asked why we chose the name "Turing". Yes, it's after Alan Turing,
but why?

First, he's of course an important figure in the history of computer science and
the world. His team at Bletchley Park played a critical role in cracking the
Axis "Enigma" machine during WWII which helped turned the tide in the Allies favor.

But the second and just-as-important reason is his death. In XXXX, Turing was
convicted for "indecency" for his relationship with another man. While there are
some alternative theories, it's generally accepted that he took his own life after
the conviction.

Intolerance robs us of our best ideas, best people, and best selves. The US programming
community is dominately made up of white, straight, males. And that's not good enough --
we're missing out.

We see our mission at the Turing School as opening the world of programming to
more people, especially those who don't fit the traditional demographics. Most of
our students come in with no development experience. We try hard to create a
welcoming environment for all people, regardless of their age, race, gender, beliefs,
or socio-economic background.

Thanks to that effort our classes look more like our society and less like the
typical tech office. But we can do better.

Locally in Denver we're working to better connect with low income communities. We've
opened our doors two nights a month for anyone to come learn about programming.
We're working to support others organizations focused on community building,
especially those that target underrepresented groups in programming.

As a team we'll do more direct contact to answer questions and help people figure
out if Turing is the right fit for them.

Next Wednesday evening we're holding an online conversation specifically
targeted at women interested in a developer training program. I'll be joined by
a few of our alumni to discuss their experiences during the program and in the
greater industry afterward.

If you or a woman you know is interested in becoming a programmer, please join us:
