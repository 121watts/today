People have asked why we chose the name "Turing". Yes, it's after Alan Turing,
but why?

He's of course an important figure in the history of computer science and
the world. His team at Bletchley Park played a critical role in cracking Germany's
"Enigma" machine during WWII which helped turned the tide in the Allies favor.

But the second and just-as-important reason is his death. In XXXX, Turing was
convicted of "indecency" for his relationship with another man. While there are
some alternative theories, it's generally accepted that he took his own life after
the conviction.

His death is a reminder that intolerance robs us of our best ideas, best people,
and best selves. The US programming community is dominantly made up of white,
straight men from middle and upper class families. That's not good enough.

We see our mission at the Turing School as opening the world of programming to
more people, especially those who don't fit the traditional demographic. We work
hard to create a welcoming environment for all people, regardless of their age,
race, gender, beliefs, socio-economic background, and programming ability.

Thanks to that effort our classes look more like our society and less like the
typical tech office. But we can do better.

Locally in Denver we're working to connect with a broader community. We've
opened our doors two nights a month for anyone to come learn about programming.
We're working to support others organizations focused on community building,
especially those who target underrepresented groups in programming.

Next Wednesday evening we're holding an online conversation specifically
targeted at women interested in developer training programs. I'll be joined by
a few of our alumni to discuss their experiences during the program and in the
greater industry afterward.

If you or a woman you know is interested in becoming a programmer, please join us:
